# Steward Sidekick

## Pitch
Mainly focused for flight attendants that are looking to find quick things to do or places to eat for layovers, but eventually it will be for any traveler. 

## MVP
- User is able to sign in and save profile.
- User is able to search for the location they will be going.
- User can add favorite locations to keep frequent locations close at hand.
- Most frequent locations (biggest hubs) accessible first
- Users will be able to create lists for locations they have been and the places they have experienced and would like to return to.

## Future Nice-to-Haves
- Social feed of places other users have liked
- Different types of users show different results. (business traveler, flight attendant/pilot, tourists)
- Ability to lock in to the users (flight attendants only) specific schedule so they can see future locations and the recommended food/events/sites for those locations.
- Specific styling to match the users airline. 
 
## Api's
- flightapi.io for tracking of a particular plane, airport schedule, location data, hotel data.
- Documenu for restaurant info (address, contact details, menu items)
- TripAdvisor Api a possible alternative to documenu for finding more user focused data (restaurant reviews, pricing, location)
